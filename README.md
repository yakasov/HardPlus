# Hard Plus

*Overwrites Hard difficulty!*

## General

Regional Difficulty (and therefore Local Difficulty) scaling has been increased:
- The moon phase is always counted as being a full moon, and consequently always adds the maximum difficulty modifier
- The 'chunk inhabited' difficulty factor increases 6x faster
- The 'time played' difficulty factor is doubled
- The starting difficulty for the calculation has been increased by 1.33x

These result in Regional Difficulty topping out at about 9 rather than 6.75.
