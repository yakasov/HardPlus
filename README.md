# Hard Plus

*Overwrites Hard difficulty!*

## General

Regional Difficulty (and therefore Local Difficulty) scaling has been increased:
- The moon phase is always counted as being a full moon, and consequently always adds the maximum difficulty modifier
- The 'chunk inhabited' difficulty factor increases 6x faster
- The 'time played' difficulty factor is doubled
- The starting difficulty for the calculation has been increased by 1.33x

These result in Regional Difficulty topping out at about 9 rather than 6.75.

## Mobs

General
- Mobs now have a follow range of 24 blocks, up from 16.
- Mobs are willing to take more fall damage to follow a target (roughly 1.25x)
- The chance for mobs to wear armour has been increased to 95% ^ Piece Number (previously 90% ^ Piece Number)
- The chance for mobs to wear higher grade armour has been doubled
- The chance for mobs to have enchanted armour has been increased by 1.5x

Cave Spiders
- Instead of inflicting Poison I for 15 seconds, they now inflict Poison II for 10 seconds.

## Items

- Diamond Tool enchantability increased to 13 (from 10)
- Diamond Armour enchantability increased to 13 (from 10)

5/10 End Crystals are now guarded in The End (from 2/10).
