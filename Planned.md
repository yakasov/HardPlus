## Player

On death, equipment will lose up to 20% durability (but will not fall below 5%)

On death, a random amount of items will be lost from stacks (but will not fall below 2)

Dropped experience no longer has a cap (from 100XP)

## Progression

???

I plan to force visits to Woodland Mansions (only one visit will be needed) and Trial Chambers (any item added will have a high chance to drop to avoid having to farm them for ages). Maybe also Ocean Monuments and Bastions?

If a visit to a Woodland Mansion is required, they'll be slightly more common (ie their minimum spawning distance requirement will be reduced)

## Structures

Stronghold
- no longer spawns with Eyes of Ender already in the frames (so 12 are required)

Villages
- chance for a village to be abandoned increased to 25% (from 2%)
